# KERNELS


> Simplicity, precision, and well-crafted systems.

## About

I enjoy understanding how systems behave at their core and refining them until only what matters remains.  
I value clarity over noise, correctness over shortcuts, and design that feels intentional.

I tend to work quietly, focusing on building things the *right* way.

---

## Languages & Tools

- **C++** — primary language, deep focus  
- **C#** — experience with managed environments  
- **Java** — solid working knowledge  

I care a lot about:
- correctness
- performance
- maintainability
- clean abstractions

---

## Principles

- Minimalism over excess  
- Precision over speed  
- Quality over quantity  

If something can be simpler, it probably should be.

---

## Philosophy

> Good software doesn’t draw attention to itself.  
> It just works — and keeps working.

---

## Notes

Most of my work is experimental, detail-oriented, and driven by curiosity.  
Not everything needs to be flashy to be effective.
